# About Me

I am an enthusiast genome biologist with great passion for genetics, genomics and epigenomics research. 
My technical expertise as computational biology and bioinformatics with advanced skills in genome data science. My work centers on unraveling the mysteries of the non-coding genome—focusing particularly on repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) and other non-coding regulatory part of the genome, —and to explore their roles in genome evolution, function, and human disease.

## Research Interests

Most of my research leverages next generation sequencing data and advanced genomics and bioinformatics methods/approaches to investigate:

- **Non-coding Genome:** Dissecting the functions of repetitive sequences (TEs and satellite DNA) in genome regulation and evolution.
- **Genome Evolution & Function:** Studying the genomic origins and evolution of supernumerary (B) chromosomes and sex chromosomes.
- **Genome Assembly and Annotation:** Developing and applying methods for genome sequencing, assembly, and detailed annotation.
- **Population Genomics:** Analyzing genome-wide SNPs to assess population diversity and understand evolutionary dynamics.



I am currently leading research projects aimed at deciphering the interplay between transposable elements and cancer. 

## Professional Commitment

My work is driven by a passion for scientific discovery and a dedication to making meaningful contributions in the field of genomics. I strive to advance our understanding of genome structure and function with the ultimate aim of translating these insights into improved human health outcomes.
