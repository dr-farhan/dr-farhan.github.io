# About Me

I am a computational genome biologist with a PhD in Biological Science (Genetics) and currently work as a postdoctoral researcher in genomics. My work centers on unraveling the mysteries of the non-coding genome—focusing particularly on repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNA—and exploring their roles in genome evolution, function, and human disease.

## Research Focus

My research leverages next generation sequencing technologies and innovative genomics applications to investigate:
- **Non-coding Genome:** Dissecting the functions of repetitive sequences (TEs and satellite DNA) in genome regulation and evolution.
- **Genome Evolution & Function:** Studying the genomic origins and evolution of supernumerary (B) chromosomes and sex chromosomes.
- **Genome Assembly and Annotation:** Developing and applying methods for genome sequencing, assembly, and detailed annotation.
- **Population Genomics:** Analyzing genome-wide SNPs to assess population diversity and understand evolutionary dynamics.

I apply these approaches to both model and non-model systems—including vertebrate species such as fish, macaque, and reptiles—with broad implications in aquaculture, biodiversity, and conservation.
